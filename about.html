                    <h3 class="bbb">Associate Dean's Message</h3>
                    <p>Dear Students <br>
                        Congratulations, to all young aspirants for being part of GNDU Regional Campus Jalandhar. <br>
                        I feel deeply honoured to share that Guru Nanak Dev University has always been an excellent
                        centre of learning for students for the last 50 years. The University Grants Commission (UGC)
                        has awarded it the highest status of 'University with Potential for Excellence' as an
                        acknowledgement to the university's contribution in teaching and cutting edge research of
                        significance. The University is also accredited with 'A++' Grade by NAAC. <br>
                        With the rapid advancement in the Information & Communication technology and emerging trends
                        based on smart infrastructures has brought new challenges. The ability to create opportunities
                        through innovation and to provide sustainable smart solutions to these contemporary challenges
                        is going to be the forte of up-coming generation. This Campus is opening up new vistas of
                        opportunities by providing professional education with human & societal values.

                        <br>
                        The combination of well designed academic curriculum and teaching methods of highest standards
                        provides productive teaching-learning process. Moreover, the constantly evolving curriculum
                        facilitates the students to stay abreast with the latest updates in this fast changing scenario.

                        <br>
                        The globally acclaimed CGPA system has been adopted by the University in which the examinations
                        are conducted and results are declared in a timely &transparent manner that empowers the
                        students, who seek placements in a competitive market or higher education in India or abroad.
                        I sincerely hope that with active participation of students, dedicated faculty and alumni- the
                        campus will continue to promote excellence in academics and research of highest standards in the
                        days to come.

                        <br> I believe that education at this campus would be a fulfilling experience, to bring out the
                        best in our young learners. I ardently desire that the moments spent here shall be cherished all
                        through your life.
